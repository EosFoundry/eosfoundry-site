# From the Top

The MakeShift is more than just a fancy desk toy with buttons, it's a macro system that is completely hackable from the hardware all the way up to the interface.

The overarching goal of the project is to drop the distance between keyboard and software. Most professional software tools have built-in plugins or extension systems. The MakeShift is designed to skip the process of setting up keybinds, alt-tabbing, and then hitting keys. Instead, provide direct access to scripts straight from a macro-pad.

This section of the library aims to document how the MakeShift works in a more... participatory manner.

TL;DR - We're going to learn how it works by building the darn thing.

Remind James to get this done ;)

## What Makes a MakeShift?

The MakeShift is built around the powerful [Teensy 4.x](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) series microcontroller, allowing very powerful capabilities that (as of writing) we're not even close to exploiting to the fullest yet.
