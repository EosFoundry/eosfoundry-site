# The MakeShift Library

:::note
The MakeShift Library is under construction, sections that are *rough* around the edges will be labelled with a little ðŸš§ icon
:::

The MakeShift is a big project with a ton of details. This library aims to document as much of it as possible - from the big picture 'get things done' stuff, all the way down to the small moving bits that make everything work.

The library is split into three major sections, each aiming to be somewhere on the sliding scale of 'useful' versus 'informative'.

Think of them on a spectrum between 'user manual' and 'blueprint'.

## Quick Start

Cut to the chase on how to get the MakeShift working - create cues, set up layouts, and troubleshoot issues.

## MakeShift In-Depth

Dive way deep into all the nitty-gritty details of how everything works from the ground up. The goal of this section is to answer 'why this?', and provide explanations and insight into how each major chunk of the MakeShift fit with the others - from the hardware, to the firmware, all the way up to the software.

## APIs

Documenting the Application Programming Interface exposed by internal libraries. This section is automatically generated from all the makeshift repos in our [GitHub](https://github.com/EosFoundry)
