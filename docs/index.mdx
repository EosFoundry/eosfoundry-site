# The MakeShift Library

The MakeShift is a big project with a ton of details. This library aims to document as much of it as possible - from the big picture 'get things done' stuff, all the way down to the small moving bits that make everything work.

The library is split into three major sections: 

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

This section aims to cut to the chase on how to get the MakeShift working - create cues, set up layouts, and troubleshoot issues.
