# Frequenly Asked Questions

## How can I support MakeShift?

Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/EosFoundry) where our code is hosted, and [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/hPw4j3vfCT) where Andy and James hang out!

The best way is to help develop the software and firmware - we are looking forward to receiving bug reports, issues, and pull requests soon.
If you don't have the time or feel up to that, we accept donations as well!

## Questions about Early Access

### What does Early Access mean?

We want to get our minimum viable product out to people so we can get the best possible feedback of what's right and what's wrong about the MakeShift - normally this is a software thing where deployment costs are close to zero. However for the MakeShift, we don't have the luxury of a large budget to test with, but we do have the luxury of building a very modular and upgradable device.

### How is the Release version going to be different from the Early Access version?

Moving from a small run of a few dozen units to a larger run of perhaps a few hundred is a pretty big leap for manufacturing and assembly, the core design can't change too much - i.e. there will be little to no functional difference. However some physical bits may differ to make it easier to assemble, or cheaper to manufacture, or easier to ship, et cetera and so on and so forth.

### Will the hardware be priced differently during and after Early Access?

Yes, we're not aiming to make any money off of the Early Access version of the MakeShift, and the price reflects more or less exactly how much it costs to produce. Our goal is to get the device in the hands of developers and tinkerers to help us along.

The version that we will produce for Kickstarter (and possibly beyond that) will need to cover the costs of development and maintenance.

### Approximately how long will the MakeShift be in Early Access?

It depends on a lot of factors, but at least until the end of 2022, if the community is happy with the state of the project by then, a sort of 1.0 release will happen.

## Ordering and Shipping

### Will it be shipped to my country?

US and Canada are covered for sure, as is Europe and the UK, if you're outside of those areas, give us a holler on Discord and we'll try to work something out!

### Can I get replacement parts?

:::note
MakeShift Alpha parts will have unknown compatibility with the version we are designing for Kickstarter
:::

There will be a MakeShift Alpha parts kit available to purchase in the coming month as we move into preparing for kickstarter, and possibly after the campaign starts, but that will depend on kickstarter requirements. 

Right now we can't guarantee replacement PCBs or case sets - unfortunately those are the only parts that are not available off-the-shelf either. However if we have a few PCBs and/or cases left over from the batches we ordered, we'll let the community know and see about making those available for sale.

If you have broken or lost some of the other parts, we've designed the MakeShift to be assembled with almost entirely off the shelf components, hopefully you would be able to find all the other parts from the bill of materials fairly easily at your local hardware supply store.

### Can I make my own version of the MakeShift?

Yup, our bill of materials is available here. We'll send CAD files for the case and PCB if you jump into Discord and give us a shout.

## What integrations are planned for the MakeShift?

We are planning for the MakeShift to have certain Core features, such as Twitch and OBS integration, as well as (hopefully) some Community and Community Requested features in the future.

We're a small team so a bit part of the focus for us is to make sure developing plugins and guides for the MakeShift is as simple as possible as we simply don't have the humans needed to support a large number of plugins for all the wonderful (or painful) software tools out there.
