# First Steps

Currently the only device that has been tested to work with makeshift-ctrl is the MakeShift Alpha. If you don't happen to have one handy, you could make one yourself! The [In-Depth](/docs/makeshift-deep-dive/) section has a guide on how to build a custom MakeShift device.

## Kit Assembly

If you have a kit, some assembly is required - take a look at the specific model page for detailed assembly instructions:

- [MakeShift Alpha](./quickstart/assembly/alpha)

## Install makeshift-ctrl



## Hello World
