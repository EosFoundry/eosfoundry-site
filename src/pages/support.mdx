# Support Us

Right now, we're in the middle of development, so the biggest support you can give is taking a look at our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EosFoundry/), submitting issues, pull requests, or taking [makeshift-ctrl](/software) out for a spin!

If you're not into software, feel free to hang out on our [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/eosfoundry).

We have a donation page on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/eosFoundry/), or buy us a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/eosfoundry)!
