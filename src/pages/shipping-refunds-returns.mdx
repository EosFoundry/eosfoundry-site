# Shipping, Refunds, Returns

## Shipping Policy

### Where does my order ship from?

We proudly ship from the province of Ontario in Canada.

### Where do you ship to?

We ship to anywhere we can get a rate quote.

Please note our flat rate international shipping is not tracked to a few countries. Our economy carriers add more tracked shipping locations all the time and unfortunately, we cannot keep a running list. Please don't hesitate to contact us at hello@eosfoundry.dev or on our Discord if you're curious about the rate of shipping for your country.

### Shipping Time

Shipping times are hugely dependent on your location and whether you select a flat rate or a calculated rate at checkout, if you're in North America, you can generally expect a Flat Rate order to arrive in 2-5 business days. The further away/more remote locations for International Flat Rate shipping can take up to 30+ days.

### Order Processing Time

Please understand that we are a small team working on evenings and weekends. Developing takes time, and so does production. We aren't perfect, but we are trying our best to ensure we fulfil the commitments that we set out. 

Currently the order processing time is at the mercy of when we receive a Teensy 4.0 (when or if they become available) for pre-built models. For kits without the Teensy 4.0, please allow 2-5 business days for your order to be processed for shipping.

Successfully placed orders will receive and email confirmation with all your order details. If you didn't receive an email, please check your Junk/Spam folders, or contact us for more information.

### How do I check the status of my order?

When your order has shipped, you will receive an email notification from us. Not all orders will have a tracking number, unless you choose to get one. The tracking number can be used to check the status of your order. Please allow 48 hours for the tracking information to become available. 

If you haven’t received your order within 30 days of receiving your shipping confirmation email, please contact us at hello@eosfoundry.dev with your name and order number so we can look into it for you.

### Non-Delivery

Please ensure your address is fully complete. We do not take any responsibility for Non-Delivery due to errors in the address you provide or after multiple delivery attempts. If an order is returned to us, due to an incorrect address, or failure to deliver after multiple attempts, we'll refund the original order (excluding the return shipping fees) and ask you to re-submit a new order.

## Refunds, returns, and exchanges

In the event your order arrives damaged in any way, please email us as soon as possible at [hello@eosfoundry.dev](mailto:hello@eosfoundry.dev) with your order number and a photo of the item’s condition. We will try our best to help diagnose the issue - and will offer replacements or refunds if necessary.

Unfortunately despite the name, we currently do not accept returns or exchanges at this time.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at [hello@eosfoundry.dev](mailto:hello@eosfoundry.dev).
