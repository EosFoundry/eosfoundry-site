Abstract: core concepts and UI

Building out the MakeShift hardware felt like solving a jigsaw puzzle - fitting the pieces together within a clear-cut set of requirements. Designing the user journey felt like playing Minecraft in creative mode - here's the world, now build something good.

As I slowly leave the well-defined lakes and rivers of hardware design, the decisions felt much more weighty and complex. On what technology stack do I build the software? How do I define maintainability? What tradeoffs am I unknowningly making if I use this pattern versus that pattern? These decisions don't have concrete answers, there's very little constraints to limit decision space, and the impacts would likely be measured in years of MakeShift's lifetime.

Probably the most complex question I've faced is what kind of experience I am designing for the future MakeShift users. I have a good idea of how I want the user to feel and the things I want them to be able to accomplish. The MakeShift should (ideally, of course) be able to work in a way that is almost expected, or invisible for a user
